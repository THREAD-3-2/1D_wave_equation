`1D_wave_equation <https://github.com/THREAD-3-2/1D_wave_equation>`_
is a MATLAB code for the dynamics of a 1-dimensional wave equation. It consists in a second-order PDE for the description of waves,
in this particular case transverse waves on a massive string. The trapezoidal quadrature rule is used to approximate the integral of
the Lagrangian function in both time and space.
